        My name is Pertunia Lesego Ndhlovu I am a self taught Web Develpoer and i started my jouney in April 2024 when i had decided to get into tech however i had discovered that i did not need to have a computer science degree but i had to work my way up in order for me to stand out and that has been my focus for me to learn the different languages which i needed to get into Web Development. I fell in love with coding to the point where it did not feel right when i would spend a day without being on my laptop and being busy on my VSCode i then decided that thi si the career path i wanted to follow and this is me. I started my learning journey through YouTube videos which is where i learnt HTML and CSS, i then decided to get more knowledge by doing some online courses and i cam across SimpliLearn which offered a course in Introduction to Front End Development and this course hwlped me a lot because i was able to learn JavaScript more and get a good understanding from the course however i also came across an opportunity by SheCodes which is an online school that helps women how to code. I ebrolled for the SheCodes foundation and i was accepted to study with SheCodes where i got an even more understanding on Web Development especially since we had to buold projects which were assessed to check if they were good or not, i got even more knowledge from the SheCodes course and i was able to build projects on my own using Html, CSS and Java Script.
